				<p>
					Oi, my name is Burak. I am a junior developer who currently work with
					C# and JavaScript/Typescript for development. I am mostly focused on
					web right now but ı have ideas about systems, ai and other part of the
					software development. In web, ı am a backend developer but as a modern
					web developer, ı learned about frontend.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I went to a software expertise course; finished some online courses
					but ı am still learning myself through other developers and sourceses
					on internet. I love open source, ı think if there is not private
					information the code; every codebase should be a open source project.
					Community makes everything better, we are building our cities
					together, why not our applications?
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I also love animals so much, they are very important for me and equals
					important to me as like a human. I hope ı can help as much as ı can to
					make world better for them.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					That's me. If you want to get to know about me more, <a
